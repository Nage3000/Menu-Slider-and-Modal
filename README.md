# Menu Slider and Modal
 A demonstration of how to create a hamburger drawer, and a disappearing cta modal. 

Hamburger menus are everywhere, especially in mobile-first designed websites. It has simple functionality with great benefits over a classic menu or footer navigation. 

The modal cleans up the interface by being hiden from view until the user calls upon it. The Javascript for the modal functionality is very simple, but it's something that's used so often.
